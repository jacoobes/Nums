# Nums

TODO <br>
KISS (keep it stupidly simple) 

- [ ] finish parsing
  - almost done
- [x] create visitor / tree walker
- [ ] fold math and boolean expressions in parse stage?
- [x] nums compiler exe using graal!
- [ ] find out how to link libs
- [ ] there are some scattered bugs with scoping and variables. need to fix that
- [ ] add more compiler options, since minivm supports other targets, why not take advantage of that?
- [ ] write tests for nums
- [ ] add optimization flags in cli
